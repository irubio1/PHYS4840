        # Subtract the appropriate multiple of the pivot row from the current row
        U[i, :] -= L[i, m] * U[m, :]

print('The lower triangular matrix L is:\n', L)
print('The upper triangular matrix U is:\n', U)

## Write the next part of this program:
##  How do we solve the system of equations using forward and backward substitution?
##  Use L and U to solve Ax = b for a given vector b.

## HINT: see the end of 6.1.4 in your textbook (equations 6.37 through 6.39 in my version)
